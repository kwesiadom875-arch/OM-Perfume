          <p>This is our most important promise. We <strong>unequivocally guarantee that every product we sell is 100% authentic</strong>, genuine, and sourced directly from the brand or their authorized distributors. We stand behind every bottle and would never risk our reputation on anything less.</p>
        </FaqItem>

        <FaqItem question="Are you an authorized reseller for these brands?">
          <p>As expert curators, we source our products from a global network of trusted suppliers and authorized distributors. While we are not a direct, single-brand "authorized dealer" in all cases, we are a trusted, independent reseller. Our expertise lies in curation and verification, which allows us to offer a wider collection than a typical retailer.</p>
        </FaqItem>

        <FaqItem question="What is your shipping policy?">
          <p>We offer standard and express shipping options. All orders are typically processed within 1-2 business days. You will receive a tracking number as soon as your order ships. For more details, please visit our (future) "Shipping & Returns" policy page.</p>
        </FaqItem>

        <FaqItem question="What is your return policy?">
           <p>Due to the nature of fragrance, we can only accept returns on items that are **unopened, unused, and still in their original, sealed packaging** within 14 days of delivery. If a product arrives damaged, please contact us immediately at [service@omperfumery.com] with a photo of the damage.</p>
